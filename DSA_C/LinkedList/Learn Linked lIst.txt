Pointers:

Pointers (pointer variables) are special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.
int* p;  --> int data type ka address store karne ke liye pointer p
Assigning values to Pointers
int c = 8;
int *ptr = &c;   --> This would store address of variable int c

Typedef:

It is used to create a name for structure being used.

typedef struct person{
    char name[50];
    int age;
    int height;
} personal_info

The to create an object of this struct we can just write personal_info p1
